# ComputerVision
All projects that encompass anything from learning OpenCV/Tensorflow with python3 to projects built using these three (not limited to these three) will be build here.


## Lesson 1
- A new beginning. For the start of this project I will run through the [Tutorials Point OpenCV Tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/opencv/opencv_storing_images.htm).
<!---For the start of this project I will run through the book "Learning OpenCV 4 Computer Vision with Python 3 (3rd Edition)" by Packt.--->
- I will be using a Raspberry Pi 4 with OpenCV installed.
